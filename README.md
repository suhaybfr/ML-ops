# AI-Based Digital Learning Assistant

## Overview

An AI-based digital learning assistant designed to predict student performance and provide personalized learning support. The system combines a machine learning model for student performance prediction with an LLM-powered conversational tutor for answering questions, explaining concepts, and generating practice questions.

The project also focuses on implementing the end-to-end **MLOps workflow**, covering data management, model development, experiment tracking, testing, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement using industry-standard tools.

## Objectives

- Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict student learning outcomes.
- Build an LLM-powered tutor using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Implement data and model versioning for reproducibility.
- Track experiments, evaluate models, and manage model versions.
- Automate testing and deployment through CI/CD.
- Monitor data drift, model performance, and application metrics.
- Implement a feedback loop for model retraining and redeployment.

## MLOps Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration:** Obtain student interaction data, perform exploratory data analysis, and identify relevant features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Prepare training data using historical student interactions.
3. **Model Development:** Train baseline models and compare their performance with XGBoost.
4. **Experiment Tracking:** Log model parameters, evaluation metrics, and artifacts using MLflow.
5. **Data and Model Versioning:** Use DVC and MLflow to support reproducible experiments and model management.
6. **Testing:** Validate data processing, model predictions, and API functionality using PyTest.
7. **Deployment:** Serve the trained model through FastAPI and containerize services using Docker.
8. **CI/CD:** Automate testing and build workflows using GitHub Actions.
9. **Monitoring:** Track data drift, prediction behaviour, application latency, and errors.
10. **Continuous Improvement:** Incorporate new student interactions, evaluate the need for retraining, and manage updated model versions.
